# Task 2: Draft a Campaign Proposal

### Steps:

1. Open the copilot research document that you saved to your OneDrive account in Task 1. Copy the URL of the document by selecting the Share button in the upper-right corner, above the ribbon and selecting Copy Link from the drop-down menu that appears.

1. Launch Microsoft Word from your browser (<a href="https://word.new" target="_blank">word.new</a>) or use the desktop application.

1. Open a new blank document.

1. Select the Copilot logo that appears at the top of the blank document to open **Draft with Copilot**.

1. Enter the following prompt into the prompt field:

    ```text
    Based on the research in [Link to Copilot Research.docx], draft a comprehensive proposal for this new Giving Campaign. The proposal should include a summary of the campaign’s objective, a detailed breakdown of expected outcomes, key strategies for success, and potential challenges. Ensure the proposal is well-structured and clearly formatted to support decision-making and stakeholder alignment.
    ```

1. Select **Generate**. At this point, Copilot in Word extracts the information from your research document and drafts the proposal.

1. Review the draft that Copilot creates. If everything looks good, you can move onto the next step.

    However, if you'd like to refine the document further, explore the information in the **Iterate and Revise** section below.

1. Save the file to your OneDrive account with the following file name: **Giving Campaign Proposal.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.

## Iterate and Revise

The iterative and revision process involves refining and improving upon an initial draft or concept through multiple rounds of feedback and adjustment. This approach helps to enhance the quality, clarity, and effectiveness of the final output by identifying areas for improvement and making targeted revisions.

For example, you might start with an initial draft of a proposal and prompt the following:

```text
Can you refine this proposal by making it more persuasive for potential sponsors?
```

After reviewing the updated version, you may further improve the document by focusing on specific sections, such as:

```text
Improve the summary to make it more concise and impactful.
```

Experimenting with these prompts allows you to refine your content through thoughtful adjustments, ultimately creating more persuasive and impactful results
