<strong>Note:</strong> While we provide sample prompts, feel free to personalize them in your own style. Be creative and experiment. If Copilot doesn't give the desired output, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process!

### Steps:

1. Open the program proposal document that you saved to your OneDrive account in Task 2. Copy the URL of the document by selecting the Share button in the upper-right corner, above the ribbon and selecting Copy Link from the drop-down menu that appears.

1. Launch Microsoft PowerPoint from your browser (<a href="https://PowerPoint.new" target="_blank">PowerPoint.new</a>) or use the desktop application.

1. Open a new blank presentation.

1. In the Copilot pane that appears, several predefined prompts are available for you to choose from. Select the Create presentation from file prompt.

1. Copy and paste the **Giving Campaign Proposal.docx** link after the words "Create a presentation from" and select **Send**.

    The full prompt should look like:

    ```text
    Create a presentation from [Link to Giving Campaign Proposal.docx].
    ```

1. Copilot will start to create a slide presentation based on the Giving Campaign Proposal document. In doing so, it displays the outline of the presentation and a list of features included in the presentation. These features may include speaker notes, images, layouts to organize slides, and a General sensitivity label.

    <strong>Note:</strong>It can take up to two minutes for the slides to fully generate. The time it takes to generate the slides depends on the complexity of the document and the number of slides that Copilot creates.

1. Once completed, you're free to review the slides and make any necessary updates. You can use the Designer tool to adjust the layouts. You can also add or remove slides and modify the content as needed to ensure the presentation aligns with your objectives. For more prompts to try out, see the next section below.

## More Prompts to Enhance Your Presentation with Copilot

Copilot in PowerPoint offers powerful tools to optimize and enhance presentations. You can leverage these features to improve the visual and structural elements of your slides, ensuring that your content is presented in the most effective way.

For example, you can ask Copilot to suggest alternative slide layouts or automatically format your presentation. A useful starting point might be to ask for recommendations on how to organize the information for maximum effectiveness:

 ```text
 What’s the best order to present this information for maximum impact?
 ```

You can also refine your presentation through iteration. For example, you might ask Copilot to focus on specific areas for improvement:

 ```text
 Give me specific examples from this presentation on how I can improve it for better engagement.
 ```

Additionally, Copilot can help you add new slides to address critical aspects of your campaign. For instance, you can generate slides that cover potential challenges and strategies:

 ```text
Add 2 slides detailing potential challenges this Giving Campaign may face, and include a slide that outlines key strategies to mitigate those challenges.
 ```

By experimenting with these prompts, you can create more engaging and polished presentations, while learning to continuously iterate and improve your designs with Copilot’s intelligent recommendations.
