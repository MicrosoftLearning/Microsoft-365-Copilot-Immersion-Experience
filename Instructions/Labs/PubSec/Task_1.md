# Task 1: Streamline Data Analysis & Insights with Microsoft 365 Business Chat

In this task, you’ll use Business Chat (BizChat) in the Microsoft 365 App to analyze data from the People Matters Survey. The goal is to gain insights into employee engagement, inclusion, and wellbeing within the organization. You’ll focus on identifying key trends, comparing organizational scores with industry benchmarks, and uncovering areas for improvement. By the end of this task, you’ll have developed recommendations or strategies that address identified challenges in your focus area, setting a foundation for further organizational development.

    - Single-Shot Prompting
    - Role Prompting (Persona-based Prompting)
    - Chain of Thought Prompting

1. Once you have finished analyzing your survey results, save Copilot's responses to the Word file you created earlier, titled **Copilot Research.docx**, for use in the next task.

## Choosing Your Prompting Technique

Each prompting technique below offers unique benefits depending on the depth of analysis you need. Choose the one that best aligns with your objectives:

- **Single-Shot Prompting** is ideal for a quick overview or broad insights.
- **Role Prompting** adds a personal and professional perspective, helping you analyze data as if you were in a specific role.
- **Chain of Thought Prompting** enables a deeper exploration of complex issues through a logical series of connected prompts.


## Single-Shot Prompting

Single-shot prompting uses a single, well-crafted prompt to get a comprehensive response from the AI, ideal when you need a quick summary or broad perspective.

Prompt examples (choose one):

```text
Compare the current People Matters Survey results [Paste link to this year's survey results] with last year's results [Paste link to last year's survey results] to identify the top three areas where employee satisfaction has shown the most improvement. 
```

```text
Identify and summarize the top three areas where employees feel most supported and engaged based on the survey results from [Paste link to People Matters Survey results]. Highlight any unique strengths that the organization could build on.
```

```text
Using data from the ‘Engagement’ and ‘Inclusion’ sections in [Paste link to People Matters Survey results], create recommendations that amplify existing strengths to further enhance employee engagement and inclusion within the organization.
```

```text
From the ‘Work-Related Wellbeing’ section in [Paste link to People Matters Survey results], identify the key factors that contribute to a positive work environment. Highlight these areas and suggest ways to sustain or expand on these strengths across teams.
```

This approach is more efficient when seeking a broad summary but may not allow the same depth as Chain of Thought prompting.

## Role Prompting (Persona-Based Prompting)

Role prompting involves instructing the AI to assume a specific role for tailored insights. Here, participants can take on the role of a senior manager responsible for a particular focus area, such as employee wellbeing, team engagement, or inclusion. This adds a personal perspective, aligning insights with specific responsibilities.

Example prompt:

```text
You are a senior manager responsible for [employee wellbeing]. Using data from [paste link to People Matters Survey], identify key strengths within your focus area where the organization’s scores are above the comparator group. Then, propose specific actions or initiatives that could help reinforce these positive outcomes and support the organization’s values.
```
<br> 
<div style="background-color: #e0f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0078D4;"> <strong>Note:</strong> Replace the bracketed text with your specific focus area as needed </div>

This technique allows you to develop recommendations that feel aligned with real-world responsibilities.

## Chain of Thought Prompting

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting breaks down complex issues into connected steps, enabling detailed analysis through a logical sequence.

Example sequence for exploring employee engagement challenges:

- **Prompt 1:**

    ```text
   Based on the People Matters Survey results, [paste link to People Matters Survey], what are the primary factors contributing to high employee engagement and satisfaction within the organization? Highlight any patterns that stand out as strengths.

    ```

- **Prompt 2:**

    ```text
    Considering these engagement strengths, can you suggest strategies or initiatives that could reinforce and build upon these areas, supporting sustained engagement?
    ```

- **Prompt 3:**

    ```text
    Finally, given these strategies, how could the organization track continued success in engagement? Identify specific metrics or indicators that would demonstrate progress and recognize ongoing positive outcomes based on future survey results.
    ```

This structured approach helps you explore engagement challenges in a way that builds toward actionable strategies and measurement plans.
