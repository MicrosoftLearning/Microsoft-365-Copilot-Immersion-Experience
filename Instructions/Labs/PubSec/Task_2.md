### Steps:

1. Enter the following prompt into the prompt field:

    ```text
    Based on the research findings in [Link to Copilot Research.docx], draft an executive briefing for our upcoming employee town hall, focusing on positive trends, areas of improvement, and key actions to enhance employee engagement, inclusion, and wellbeing.
    ```

1. Select **Generate**. At this point, Copilot in Word extracts the information from your research document and drafts the proposal.

1. Review the draft that Copilot creates. If everything looks good, you can move on to the next step.

    However, if you'd like to refine the document further, explore the information in the **Iterate and Revise** section below.

[//]: # ( 1. Save the file to your OneDrive account with the following file name: **executive briefing.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.)

## Iterate and Revise

The iterative revision process enhances the quality, clarity, and impact of the town hall summary by making targeted adjustments based on audience needs. Here are example prompts to help refine specific sections:

For example, you might start with an initial draft of a proposal and prompt the following:

```text
Can you revise this briefing to make it more inspiring and accessible for a general employee audience?
```

After reviewing the updated version, you may further improve the document by focusing on specific sections, such as:

```text
Add a concluding section that reinforces the organizationâ€™s commitment to supporting employees and fostering a positive workplace culture.
```

Experiment with different prompts to refine your summary, ensuring it resonates with employees and conveys a sense of positive momentum and commitment to their experience.
