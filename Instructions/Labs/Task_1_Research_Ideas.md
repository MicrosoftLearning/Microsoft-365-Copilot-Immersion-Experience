# Task 1: Research Campaign Ideas

Using Business Chat in the Microsoft 365 App (Microsoft.com/Copilot), research Giving Campaign ideas and philanthropic initiatives that align with corporate social responsibility goals. Focus on identifying successful strategies and emerging trends, with the goal of brainstorming and developing at least one new Giving Campaign idea inspired by your findings. This task is about generating an idea to build on in the next steps.

### Steps:

1. To launch Business Chat, open a new Edge browser tab and navigate to <a href="https://Microsoft.com/Copilot" target="_blank">Microsoft.com/Copilot</a>.

2. If prompted to sign in, log into your work account.

3. With BizChat open, ensure that the **Web tab** is selected:

4. Explore one or more of the prompting techniques below to help guide your research in Business Chat:

    - Single-Shot Prompting
    - Role Prompting (Persona-based Prompting)
    - Chain of Thought Prompting

5. Once you are finished researching your new Giving Campaign idea, save your program idea insights to the Word file you created earlier, titled **Copilot Research.docx**, for use in the next task.

## Single-Shot Prompting

Single-shot prompting is a technique where a single, well-crafted prompt is used to generate a comprehensive response from the AI. This method works best when you need a quick, broad overview or when the problem or question is relatively straightforward. It allows the AI to generate a full response in one go, without the need for iterative questions.

For example:

```text
Can you provide an overview of recent trends in corporate Giving Campaigns that have successfully engaged communities and driven positive change?
```

In this method, you rely on the AI's ability to provide a detailed and holistic response based on the single prompt. This approach is more efficient when you're seeking a broad summary or a quick solution, but it may not allow for the same depth of exploration as Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.

## Role Prompting (Persona-Based Prompting)

Role prompting, or persona-based prompting, involves asking the AI to take on a specific role or perspective to tailor its responses. By assigning the AI a particular identity—such as an employee, a team lead, or an industry expert—you can generate responses that are more aligned with the responsibilities, goals, and mindset of that persona. This technique helps guide the AI’s responses toward more contextually relevant insights that reflect the challenges and priorities of that role.

Here’s an example of how you could apply role prompting:

```text
You are an employee at a Fortune 500 company, and you've been tasked with creating a grassroots Giving Campaign focused on environmental sustainability. How would you engage your colleagues and ensure the campaign aligns with the company's sustainability goals?
```

In this prompt, the AI assumes the role of a corporate employee tasked with running a sustainability-focused campaign, with the goal of rallying internal support and aligning with corporate values.

Or, you can refine the focus further:

```text
You are an employee at a large organization who is passionate about improving educational opportunities for underserved communities. You want to lead a new Giving Campaign centered around increasing access to technology in local schools. What steps would you take to mobilize your colleagues, build community partnerships, and ensure that the campaign has a lasting impact?
```

Using role prompting in this way allows you to think critically about your role within the organization and develop a campaign that aligns with both internal goals and external impact. It adds a personal and professional perspective, helping you tailor the campaign for maximum effectiveness.

## Chain of Thought Prompting

A CoT prompt is a series of connected questions or statements designed to guide a person or AI through a step-by-step reasoning process. It helps break down complex topics by prompting the thinker to address one aspect at a time, building on previous responses to develop a deeper understanding or more comprehensive solution. Each step in the chain encourages reflection or analysis, with each question leading logically to the next, facilitating structured problem-solving or exploration.

For example

- **Prompt 1:**

    ```text
    Can you help identify common challenges faced by corporate Giving Campaigns in engaging communities or driving long-term impact?
    ```

- **Prompt 2:**

    ```text
    Based on those challenges, can you suggest innovative campaign elements that could help overcome these obstacles?
    ```

- **Prompt 3:**

    ```text
    Now, considering those elements, which single campaign idea would likely have the most significant impact and be feasible for my team to execute? Please prioritize based on potential for community engagement and scalability.
    ```

By using a CoT prompt, you encourage deeper engagement with the subject matter, leading to more thoughtful and well-rounded answers. This approach fosters a logical progression of ideas, making it easier to explore complex scenarios and arrive at actionable insights.
