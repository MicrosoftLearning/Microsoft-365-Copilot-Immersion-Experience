# Task 4: Collaborate Using Pages

In this task, you’ll explore the new **Pages** functionality, a dynamic, shareable space for collaboration and idea organization.

Currently, Pages is only available when using the Work tab scope in Business Chat; however, this functionality will be coming to the **Web tab** scope in the future.

<strong>Note:</strong> While we provide sample prompts, feel free to personalize them in your own style. Be creative and experiment. If Copilot doesn't give the desired output, refine your prompt and try again. Enjoy the process!

1. Type the following prompt into the chat:

    ```text
    What are the key steps we should take to launch a successful Giving Campaign within our company?
    ```

1. A new **Pages** window will open. This is a collaborative space where you and others can work together in real-time. To share the Page, type the "@" symbol followed by a colleague’s name.

1. After adding your colleague, click on their name to give them access. They will receive an email notification with a link to collaborate on the Page:

1. Once your colleague has access, you are free to work together to refine the ideas and organize steps for the Giving Campaign.
